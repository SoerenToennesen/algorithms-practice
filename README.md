# Algorithm practice problems

This repository stores my practice algorithm and data structures coding problems.

## Structure

I have practised on Codility and LeetCode tests, each structured in easy, medium and hard questions. Specifically the Codility tests are divided by lessons, as the tests test a different subject.
